The PWA install popup is working but looks unprofessional.
Redesign and rebuild it with a premium, modern UI.

Goals:
- Make the install prompt look like a real startup / big-tech web app
- Smooth animations
- Clean glassmorphism style
- Mobile-first, but works perfectly on desktop

Requirements:

1. Install Popup UI
Create a centered modal (not browser default) with:
- App icon at the top
- Title: "Install Ashwathama App"
- Description: "Faster access, offline support, and app-like experience"
- Two buttons:
  - Primary: Install
  - Secondary: Not now

Design:
- Glassmorphism / soft blur background
- Rounded corners (16–20px)
- Dark theme friendly
- Subtle shadow
- Slide-up + fade-in animation

2. Behavior (Android + Desktop)
- Use beforeinstallprompt event
- Prevent browser mini-infobar
- Show popup only if app is not installed
- Store dismissal in localStorage
- Do not show popup again if dismissed
- Close popup after install attempt

3. Apple iOS Support
Since iOS Safari does not support install events:
- Detect iOS Safari users
- Show a custom instruction banner/modal instead of install button
- Text:
  "To install Ashwathama:
   Tap Share → Add to Home Screen"
- Include icons or visual cues
- Allow dismissal and remember it in localStorage

4. Desktop Support (PC / Mac)
- Ensure PWA is installable on Chrome and Edge
- App must open in standalone mode after install
- Popup should scale properly on large screens

5. Technical Rules
- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- No external libraries
- Use manifest.json and service-worker.js if not already present
- Clean, commented code
- Accessible (buttons clickable, readable text)

6. Files to Modify or Create
- index.html (popup HTML + JS logic)
- CSS (inline or separate)
- Keep existing site content untouched

7. Output
Return:
- Final code snippets
- Explanation of how install detection works
- Steps to test on:
  - Android Chrome
  - iOS Safari
  - Windows / macOS Chrome or Edge
